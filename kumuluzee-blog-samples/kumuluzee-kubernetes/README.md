# KumuluzEE microservices on Kubernetes

This example contains two cloud-native Java EE microservice applications, implemented using KumuluzEE 
microservice framework, and demonstrates how to deploy them to Kubernetes cluster.

Implemented microservices:
* **customers** - managing customer entities, and
* **orders** - managing order entities

Both microservices are implemented following cloud-native concepts and functionalities that are essential in microservice architecture, such as configuration management with MicroProfile API and service discovery.
